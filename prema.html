        <h3>"Vela Vela Vennel"song by :Purnachary</h3>
        <pre>Vela Vela Vennel Entha
        Moments shimmering with the brilliance of the full moon, 
        
        
        Meedha Vaali Velugunantha
        As if light itself ascends gracefully above,
        
        
        Moyamante Nenu Entha.. Arere
        If it’s merely an illusion, then how profound am I… oh dear!
        
        
        Chinni Gunde Unnadhentha
        How much resides in this little heart,
        
        
        Haayi Nimpi Gaalinantha
        As tender as a gentle, caressing breeze,
        
        
        Oodhamante Oopirentha.. Arere
        And what is a breath, if not the very essence of life… oh my!
        
        
        Kallu Rendu Pusthakaalu
        Two eyes that are like open books,
        
        
        Bhasha Leni Aksharaalu
        Silent letters, free of spoken language,
        
        
        Choopulone Ardhamayye.. Anni Maatalu
        In a single glance, every word finds its meaning.
        
        
        Mundhu Leni Aanavaalu
        Unspoken promises linger ahead,
        
        
        Leniponi Kaaranaalu
        Along with reasons left unvoiced within,
        
        
        Kotha Kotha Onamaalu.. Enni Maayalu
        Where new vows and countless enchantments arise.
        
        
        Kathalenno Chepparu Kavithalu Rasaru
        Endless tales have been told and countless poems have been written.
        
        
        Kaalaalu Dhaataaru
        Lifetimes have been devoted,
        
        
        Yuddhaalu Chesaaru Premalo..
        Battles have been waged in the realm of love,
        
        
        Thappu Ledhu Premalo..
        For in love, there lies no mistake.

        Meedha Vaali Velugunantha
        As if light itself ascends gracefully above,
        
        
        Moyamante Nenu Entha.. Arere
        If it’s merely an illusion, then how profound am I… oh dear!
        
        
        Aakaasham Thaakaali Ani Undha
        Does the sky long for an embrace so vast,
        
        
        Naatho Raa Chupisthaa Aa Saradha
        Come with me and reveal that mesmerizing charm,
        
        
        Nelanthaa Chuttese Veelundha
        To encircle me for eternity,
        
        
        Emundhi Premisthe Saripodha
        When love reigns supreme, nothing else compares.
        
        
        Aaha Mabbulanni Kommalai
        Oh, gather all the clouds as if they were blossoms,
        
        
        Poolavaana Pampithe
        And send them forth like a fragrant garland,
        
        
        Aa Vaana Peru Prema Le
        For that rain is called love,
        
        
        Dhaani Ooru Manamu Le
        Its dwelling place found within our hearts,
        
        
        Eh Manasuni Yemadagaku Ye Rujuvini..
        What marvel in this heart can ever measure up?
        
        
        Oh.. Anthe.. Oh..
        Oh… that’s it… oh…
